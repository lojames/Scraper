  - :body: The Halal Guys is iconic NYC. Everyone used to flock here after a night
      in the clubs back in the 00&#39;s.  The lines were long.  The customers drunk,
      boisterous and oftentimes looking to pick a fight.  And someone would always
      wait to buy food for everyone else.  10 combos, extra white sauce please.  <br><br>Nowadays,
      the lines are short and orderly.  Everyone knows they&#39;ll get their food.  DH
      and I were walking to Hells Kitchen last week when we passed Halal Guys.  We
      reminisced about all the times we ate their combo plate, we had even made it
      a moving day ritual at one time.  Of course, we stopped in our tracks, skipping
      out on our reservation and got on line.  We needed to see if the food was even
      close to our memories.  The line moved fast.  DH ordered a regular combo and
      I ordered a small falafel platter as I stopped eating meat 2 years ago. Both
      come with yellow rice, lettuce and pita.  The white sauce was just as good as
      I remember it.  You need it, the food is a bit dry without it and the hot sauce
      is as spicy as I remember it.  Use sparingly!!  You will ruin your food if you
      use too much, in addition to burn your mouth!  Use a little at a time, you can
      always add more!  My falafel was decent, not the best I&#39;ve ever had, but
      the white sauce and hot sauce made the dish.  The small was just the right portion
      size. <br><br>I don&#39;t usually eat street meat so don&#39;t have a point
      of comparison.  I can say you should eat at Halal Guys though because it&#39;s
      still the best street meat I&#39;ve ever eaten!

      hard to eat standing up. Not a complaint because that&#39;s what happens when
      you go to a food truck. So if comfort is really important then this might not
      be the right spot. <br><br>Overall really good, and I highly recommend it.

      is a food cart. Though now, they have multiple branches in the city itself and
      also all over the country and the world which are not food carts but food joints
      with sitting space.<br><br>Simple menu - chicken (great tasting), beef (even
      better tasting), pork (not anymore at this cart for some reason - but again
      is great tasting), falafel (kind of okay tasting) - over yellow over rice. With
      white sauce (yum - put lots), hot sauce (yum but very spicy. Pro tip- put only
      a few drops ..it would burn your mouth !!!!) and bbq sauce (good). <br>This
      joint doesn&#39;t have it but some of them also have gyros and baklava (very
      sweet but really good).<br><br>$7 per plate (was $6 till very recently) - huge
      portions - would easily last 2 meals.<br><br>Open till late. And almost till
      4 am on the weekends. Have had many a post-binge-drinking-night-3am-meals here
      !<br><br>Only con - No sitting at this location. So people mostly do a take
      away or sit on the parapets of the surrounding buildings.<br><br>Always a long

      2 packets of white sauce which is world popular and one of the main reason why
      halal guys is soooo popular. You also get few packets of red sauce. It&#39;s
      extremely spicy but adds a good flavor. <br><br>They didn&#39;t have any baklava

  - :body: My girlfriend from NYC directed us to eat here. Her specific instruction
      was to go to &#34;The Halal Guys&#34; cart. The name must have all three words,
      no less/no more, or else you&#39;re eating at a copy cat! THE. HALAL. GUYS.
      Remember that! And, it&#39;s the cart across the street from Hilton on W 53rd
      and 6th.<br><br>We found THE HALAL GUYS! Lol. Yep, there was a little wait on
      a Thursday at 1:30pm. But, not too long. A huge batch of meats were already
      prepared on the hot plate and ready to be scooped up and placed into a round
      foil platter or wrapped up into a sandwich.<br><br>Between the two of us, we
      decided to share a regular size Platter C, which was the Chicken and Beef Gyro
      combo. Lettuce, chicken, and beef over a bed of turmeric and cumin seasoned
      basmati rice with a few small slices of pita bread. Our plate was placed into
      a plastic bag with two packets of their famous white sauce and one packet of
      red sauce.<br><br>Now, my friend said the sauce packets are like gold. So, the
      smart thing to do is drizzle some sauce onto your food from the bottles at the
      cart and then you can save your packets for later! Unfortunately, no sauce bottles
      at the cart. Not sure if they discontinued this offering. Probably caught onto
      the sauce hype because I hear they actually charge for extra packets. The other
      tip, even if you love spicy, was to only squirt the red sauce into one corner
      instead of ALL OVER like the white sauce. Lol. I can see why. Trust me. It&#39;s
      hotttt!!!! And I love spicy!!!!<br><br>So since we were on vacay and didn&#39;t
      have an office to return to, we actually walked into the nearest Starbucks to
      purchase some cold beverages and then feast on our plates (we noticed others
      doing this, too!) in an air conditioned space.<br><br>The verdict?? OMG!! So
      DELICIOUS!! The chicken and beef were nicely seasoned and chopped in such a

      like a chicken over rice platter at 2:00 in the morning. However, there has
      to be well over a thousand in the city. But this one? This is THE Halal Cart.
      <br><br>I&#39;m not sure if this was the first, or how this cart came to stardom,
      but this was the cart that started the national chain of Halal Guys locations.
      They&#39;re fast, they&#39;re efficient, and they make some good food.<br><br>You&#39;ll
      see people lined up from streets away below their yellow umbrellas... and the
      lines MOVE. You can be in the back of a line of 30 people, and still get your
      food within minutes. Right near the carts is a block of public benches, providing
      a good place to sit down with your food.<br><br>The regular sized platter itself
      is enough food for the entire day in one sitting, but they also offer a small
      sized platter or gyros.<br><br>All in all, if you want to eat a lot for cheap
      in New York City, and you want it fast? Go to the Halal Guys.

      We ordered the chicken and gyro combo platter. Not to be extra, but this is
      literally the best Hala food (and food in general) that we&#39;ve ever had.
      Their portions were perfect, the meat was well seasoned, the rice was unique,
      and their hot sauce packs a punch!  Everything went perfectly together. <br><br>Overall:
      One of the best food places in New York. Everybody needs to eat here at some
      point in their life. You get more than your money&#39;s worth here and won&#39;t

      offs&#34; throughout the city so be aware of the fact if you are searching for
      them.<br><br>There happened to be no line when I got there but sure enough I

      though I wanted a $6.00 beef gyro I ended up with a $9.00 beef halal dinner!<br><br>I
      took my meal to the hotel room and ate it there. This meat is very good and
      it is accompanied by a salad, rice, and sliced pita bread. They also give you
      a white sauce and hot sauce if you want to add to it. I used the white sauce
      and it was so good and very filling.<br><br>You can&#39;t beat a bargain like
      that here in NY. There&#39;s no best time to go but I did notice two more stands
      in the same general vicinity. They are marked &#34;the real&#34; Halal guys.  I

      extra hot sauces. They sure know the fastest way to my heart. Meat + rice +
      EXTRA hot sauce. What else can I possibly ask for? <br><br>Apparently this place
      started all the way back in 1990, and 3 partners came up with a halal food cart
      with chicken and gyro over rice because of a high demand from Muslim cab drivers!
      Good thing they did because I freaking LOVE this place. <br><br>Whenever I come
      up to NY for work, I stand in the ridiculous line that goes for a block or two
      so that I can buy 4 - 6 platters of Combo ($8/each) to bring back home (Baltimore)
      with me. Of course, extra hot sauce please! <br><br>When I get home, I open
      up these bad boys, drown them in their famous white and red sauce. CAUTION:
      their red/hot sauce is ACTUALLY spicy!!!! I thought I was born with an iron
      stomach that can withstand all levels of spice but Halal Guys proved me wrong
      - usually 1 packet of red sauce for the entire platter is enough but I like
      to push my limit and put 2 - 3 packets. YESSSSSS, BURN MY SOUL!!!!<br><br>Their
      pita bread does get soggy because it sits in the platter on the way home but
      this is easily fixed if I pop them into the toaster oven for a few minutes!'

      a moving day ritual at one time.  Of course, we stopped in our tracks, skipping
      out on our reservation and got on line.  We needed to see if the food was even
      close to our memories.  The line moved fast.  DH ordered a regular combo and
      I ordered a small falafel platter as I stopped eating meat 2 years ago. Both
      come with yellow rice, lettuce and pita.  The white sauce was just as good as
      I remember it.  You need it, the food is a bit dry without it and the hot sauce
      is as spicy as I remember it.  Use sparingly!!  You will ruin your food if you

      basmati rice with a few small slices of pita bread. Our plate was placed into
      a plastic bag with two packets of their famous white sauce and one packet of
      red sauce.<br><br>Now, my friend said the sauce packets are like gold. So, the
      smart thing to do is drizzle some sauce onto your food from the bottles at the
      cart and then you can save your packets for later! Unfortunately, no sauce bottles
      at the cart. Not sure if they discontinued this offering. Probably caught onto
      the sauce hype because I hear they actually charge for extra packets. The other
      tip, even if you love spicy, was to only squirt the red sauce into one corner
      instead of ALL OVER like the white sauce. Lol. I can see why. Trust me. It&#39;s
      hotttt!!!! And I love spicy!!!!<br><br>So since we were on vacay and didn&#39;t
      have an office to return to, we actually walked into the nearest Starbucks to

    :comment: "$9- regular combo platter"
    :body: Because of this place&#39;s insane popularity, i decided to take the subway
      here just to try it out. It was around 6pm and still raining a bit. I ordered
      a combo platter and got my food very fast because all the guy did was scoop
      the content from the containers. <br><br>I don&#39;t know if they normally would
      refresh it up when it&#39;s not raining, but maybe because they didn&#39;t,
      the meat felt a bit dry. Rice was good, i always enjoy Mediterranean rice. The
      vegetable portion was just iceberg lettuce. Where sauce was decent. Hot sauce
      was supppper hot like the dry hot type that just burns. The whole experience
      just felt underwhelming and disappointing. I have had tastier Mediterranean
      food from other food stands of NYC.

      a good place to sit down with your food.<br><br>The regular sized platter itself
      is enough food for the entire day in one sitting, but they also offer a small
      sized platter or gyros.<br><br>All in all, if you want to eat a lot for cheap

    :body: 'Atmosphere: Looked like other Halal carts. The menu is simple and easy
      to navigate.<br><br>Service: Fast service! There was no line since we went at
      an awkward time (10:30 am), but the line looked longer during the lunch rush.<br><br>Food:
      We ordered the chicken and gyro combo platter. Not to be extra, but this is
      literally the best Hala food (and food in general) that we&#39;ve ever had.
      Their portions were perfect, the meat was well seasoned, the rice was unique,
      and their hot sauce packs a punch!  Everything went perfectly together. <br><br>Overall:
      One of the best food places in New York. Everybody needs to eat here at some
      point in their life. You get more than your money&#39;s worth here and won&#39;t
      be disappointed! We&#39;d recommend beating the lunch/dinner rushes and having
      a drink to pair with the delicious hot sauce!'

  - :body: A historic deli in the heart of the Lower East Side. This delicatessen
      isn&#39;t just an eatery, it&#39;s an institution and has remained virtually
      untouched since 1917, when it opened in its current location (originally opened
      across the street in 1888). This was an important congregating spot for newly
      immigrated families in the early 20th century. <br><br>Their pastrami is incredible
      and famous. They cure it for over 30 DAYS and it shows. Tender, melts in your
      mouth. They always give you a tasting before you buy. <br><br>We ordered the
      pastrami on rye, the corned beef on rye, the cold roast beef, 2 matzah ball
      soups, and it all comes with a plate of their half and full sours. The pickles
      are INCREDIBLE and I miss being able to find those crunchy half sours in California.
      <br><br>Everything was perfection. Next time, we&#39;d share one sandwich. They
      are that big!!

      so I knew I had to go when I visited New York. But also, so many people have
      told me I had to make a stop there. My friend and I went pretty early in the
      morning and it was our first time there, so we were a bit confused about the
      process. Since there weren&#39;t many people there, the workers were a bit more
      patient with us. We just ordered the classic pastrami and we&#39;re so glad
      that the two of us shared it because it was a monster of a sandwich! I&#39;m
      usually not a big fan of mustard, but the mustard added a nice and slight kick.
      Also, the pickles - perfect. <br><br>When you walk in, you get a ticket (DONT
      LOSE THIS). On the very right side there&#39;s a smaller menu, but they also

      order anything, they are super strict about returning the ticket when you exit.<br><br>I
      split a pastrami on rye with my friend and let me tell you....I don&#39;t like
      pastrami. Never have and thought I never would. Actually, not even a huge fan
      of sandwiches. But this specific sandwich is BOMBBBBB. Serving size is pretty
      big so I&#39;d recommend splitting with a friend if you&#39;re not that hungry
      or can&#39;t eat that much. Ingredients are prepared fresh and the pickles that
      come with the sandwich are the perfect amount of juice and crunch. When they
      ask you how much mustard you want on your sandwich, don&#39;t hold back. Tell
      them to pour that thangggg ON. Their mustard is so bomb and I regret not adding
      more to the sandwich initially.<br><br>I&#39;m salivating thinking about this,
      tbh. There&#39;s a reason why Katz&#39;s has 11,000+ reviews. If you are ever
      in New York, GO!!! No matter your schedule, make room for this.

      both locals and tourists come here to get their famous pastrami sandwich.<br><br>Need
      to know:<br>1)When you arrive, you will be handed a ticket. This ticket allows
      you to order, do not lose this ticket or you will have to pay extra.<br>2)Know
      what you want before you get to the front. You will get kicked to the back of
      the line if you reach the front... and locals will laugh.<br><br>The hot pastrami
      sandwich is the go to sandwich. Smoked and juicy pastrami between two slices
      of bread. It is a delight! Along with the pickles and cucumbers, it makes for
      the perfect lunch.

      30 minutes to try this place out. Being that I&#39;m from LA, their setup kind
      of reminded me of Philippe&#39;s setup back home (obviously they sell different
      things though). <br><br>We ordered the combo sandwich which came with both pastrami
      and corned beef. The sandwich was about $21, but was definitely more than enough
      to share for two people.<br><br>The pastrami was some of the best pastrami&#39;s
      I&#39;ve ever had...EVER. It was definitely drool-worthy and just had that type
      of taste where you want to close your eyes after that first bite. <br><br>The
      corned beef, however, was a little odd for me. It didn&#39;t have the same flavor
      that I&#39;m familiar with. Maybe that&#39;s how the restaurant makes it, but
      to me it had a weird after taste. <br><br>IMO: Skip the corned beef and stick
      with the pastrami! <br><br>Definitely a must visit place when coming to NYC!'

  - :body: Katz&#39;s is a very popular Lower East Side deli. They&#39;re famous for
      their large meat sandwiches. Ive heard several people say its the best corned
      beefed/or rueben they&#39;ve ever had. I&#39;m not a huge meat eater so I usually
      get fries and a soda. <br><br>Extremely popular with tourists, this place is
      always packed with a line out the door. Its chaotic and hard to understand how
      it all works. <br><br>A few notes that might help you:<br><br>-You take a ticket
      and go to the counter to order your food from the men making it or sit down
      at a Waiter Table.<br>-Tables against the wall are Waiter Service Only, tables
      in the middle are Self Serve meaning you order at the counter then sit down.
      <br>-The front door register is cash only. If you&#39;re paying with a card,
      pay at the back register.<br><br>This is a no frills cafeteria style diner with
      high prices, rushed orders and wet school lunch trays. The French fries were
      ok. <br><br>We take out of town relatives here because they&#39;ve heard of
      it and they want to go but we never go outside of that.

      a tourist trap, and if I were local, the pastrami is worth the extra $, as it
      is, hands down, the best I&#39;ve ever had.  <br><br>How many of us have ever
      had warm pastrami?!<br><br>It&#39;s the rest that falls apart. <br><br>We sat
      and waited too long for our waitress to show.  They gave us a SUBSTANTIAL amount
      of pickles that were WAY too salted to enjoy.  I love fresh pickles but these
      aren&#39;t what you&#39;d expect.  It feels like a huge waste to assume 4 people
      want a pile of pickles. <br><br>The babes enjoyed the roast beef on their sandwich
      but the bread that came with our sandwiches was not worth the $20+ price of
      them. <br><br>I would recommend splitting a sandwich and seeking out a salad
      elsewhere to offset the insane pile of meat.  <br><br>The latkes were super
      thick and filling and large (and I enjoyed the flavor), but too cooked for my
      mom&#39;s taste and didn&#39;t come with enough sauce and sour cream. <br><br>I

      to trying them out until recently because it was my friend&#39;s birthday and
      she wanted to go. <br><br>It&#39;s mad busy in here, luckily when I arrived
      there was no line outside and only a 20-minute wait for table service.  The
      alternative was a wait to order in one of the many sandwich lines and then seat
      ourselves in the communal seating areas. Oh yeah, there&#39;s two big security
      guards at the door on the way in and out.  One gives you a pink ticket on the
      way in that gets marked once you&#39;ve paid for your meal, the other checks
      to see if said ticket is marked on the way out. Also, don&#39;t lose the ticket
      or it will cost you a pretty penny in fees on the way out.  You could argue
      with them like I saw a family doing when I came in, but by the looks of the
      security gaurds, I wouldn&#39;t want any smoke with them.<br><br>Anyways, the
      food was fabulous.  The pastrami was amazing. It literally melts in your mouth
      and was everything with a side of mayonnaise. The matzo ball soup was delicious
      as well, it was my first time having it and I was impressed. I also dig that
      this place makes its own lemonade.  Moreover, Katz is pretty pricey but the

      frankfurters and pastrami on rye to share. My favourite is the Pastrami on Rye.
      Expensive but worth every cent. Comes with two types of pickles too.. definitely
      plenty to share between two. <br><br>Each adults are given a green ticket each
      so they can figure out what you have ordered. If you are paying by card then
      pay at the back corner, right hand side. Cash is taken at the entrance of the
      restaurant. Green tickets are checked before you exit to make sure you are all
      settled with all the charges. <br><br>People are also given the choice of self
      service vs. full service tables. I opted for the self service option given it
      was pretty early and there were tables readily available. <br><br>Left just
      a little bit over 12:30pm and there wasn&#39;t a queue outside. Four frankfurters
      and a pastrami on rye ended up just a tad over $50.

      Also, the pickles - perfect. <br><br>When you walk in, you get a ticket (DONT
      LOSE THIS). On the very right side there&#39;s a smaller menu, but they also
      just have it up on the wall. You order wherever someone is ready to take your
      order, you grab your stuff, take it to the cashier and they write on your ticket.
      You go and eat, then once you&#39;re done, go back to the cashier and pay. They&#39;ll
      give you your ticket and receipt back and you have to hand it to the guy at
      the door, and then you&#39;re good to go.

    :body: Katz&#39;s is a very popular Lower East Side deli. They&#39;re famous for
      their large meat sandwiches. Ive heard several people say its the best corned
      beefed/or rueben they&#39;ve ever had. I&#39;m not a huge meat eater so I usually
      get fries and a soda. <br><br>Extremely popular with tourists, this place is
      always packed with a line out the door. Its chaotic and hard to understand how
      it all works. <br><br>A few notes that might help you:<br><br>-You take a ticket
      and go to the counter to order your food from the men making it or sit down
      at a Waiter Table.<br>-Tables against the wall are Waiter Service Only, tables
      in the middle are Self Serve meaning you order at the counter then sit down.
      <br>-The front door register is cash only. If you&#39;re paying with a card,
      pay at the back register.<br><br>This is a no frills cafeteria style diner with
      high prices, rushed orders and wet school lunch trays. The French fries were
      ok. <br><br>We take out of town relatives here because they&#39;ve heard of
      it and they want to go but we never go outside of that.

      food was fabulous.  The pastrami was amazing. It literally melts in your mouth
      and was everything with a side of mayonnaise. The matzo ball soup was delicious
      as well, it was my first time having it and I was impressed. I also dig that
      this place makes its own lemonade.  Moreover, Katz is pretty pricey but the
      food and the experience are worth it.<br><br>All in all, I can finally say that
      I&#39;ve had what she&#39;s having and it was absolutely delicious.

    :body: Got here just before the Sat tourist lunch rush circa 11:40am. Ordered
      frankfurters and pastrami on rye to share. My favourite is the Pastrami on Rye.
      Expensive but worth every cent. Comes with two types of pickles too.. definitely
      plenty to share between two. <br><br>Each adults are given a green ticket each
      so they can figure out what you have ordered. If you are paying by card then
      pay at the back corner, right hand side. Cash is taken at the entrance of the
      restaurant. Green tickets are checked before you exit to make sure you are all
      settled with all the charges. <br><br>People are also given the choice of self
      service vs. full service tables. I opted for the self service option given it
      was pretty early and there were tables readily available. <br><br>Left just
      a little bit over 12:30pm and there wasn&#39;t a queue outside. Four frankfurters
      and a pastrami on rye ended up just a tad over $50.

  - :body: Hooray For Dendur!<br><br>Today, I think I experienced a miracle. Let me
      tell you a little bit of backstory first, though. I have been running all over
      town buying C B D products for my wife, Wanda. She has been in what the doctors
      are calling a &#34;rapidly deteriorating condition&#34; for one wee3k now. I
      was trying to keep her awake by playing old episodes of American Gladiator,
      her favorite show, but she has been sleeping for the past two days now. Finally,
      I got her up and gave her another CBD infused olive shake, which got her a little
      nergized. I asked her &#34;Wanda is there anything you want to do now before
      it&#39;s too late?&#34; she told me &#34;yes&#34; and &#34;I want to go to the
      Met Museum to see the Dendur Temple. &#34; My eyes got wide as saucers. But
      of course I said &#34;yes.&#34; So I loaded her up in the car and got her caretaker&#39;s
      approval and we zoomed off to Cendtral PArk. <br>Okay, back to the main point.
      But first, one small complaint. The staff at the museum told my wife she wasn&#39;t
      following the dress code because she was wearing her hospice gown. They said
      she would have to cover up if she wanted to come in the museum. But I gave them
      a piece of my mind! But then I had to go to the bathroom. When I got back there
      was a whole crowd of young people taking pictures of her on their Smart Phones.
      They all asked me some questions about the Camp exhibit and I told them this
      isn&#39;t Camp, kids, its the Metropolitan Museum of Art! Kids these days are
      really idiots. Anyway, the guard figured out that Wanda was coming into the
      museum one way or the other so they let us through.<br>We got to the Dendur
      Temple and I rolled my Wanda right on past the line and straight into that temple
      gate. Then all the sudden she starts moaning. The guards asked me sir is your
      wife alright? And she was thrashing and said &#34;O Horus!!&#34; I said &#34;Wanda
      did I give you too much CBD?&#34; Then she sat straight up and looked in my
      eyes and said , &#34; My Husband, I am healed!&#34; Needless to say, I will
      be coming back to the Metropolitan Museum and to the Dendur Temple many many
      more times!! Would recommend to anyone who needs  a little &#39;Pick me Up!&#34;

      ones in the world, and the Met ranks right up there.  <br><br>It&#39;s so easy
      to get lost inside, but that&#39;s kinda what makes it fun.<br><br>They&#39;ve
      got a diverse collection, and you&#39;ll need several trips to really just be
      able to walk and look through a fraction of it.<br><br>Saw the Camp exhibit,
      and was pleased that there wasn&#39;t an additional charge for it like many
      other Museums might have had.

      We spent a total of about six hours there and still didn&#39;t cover everything.
      It was a good idea to start on the second floor and work our way down to avoid
      crowds. Among the exhibits that we enjoyed were Egypt, Ancient Greece and Rome,
      Van Gogh. Monet, American, Chinese, Cyprus, Africa, Medieval Times and Modern.
      <br><br>We didn&#39;t eat there so that we could cover as much of the museum

  - :body: A review long overdue, considering I&#39;ve been here upwards of ten times
      over the quarter century I&#39;ve been living in New York! They restructured
      the whole place a few years ago, so the layout makes a lot more sense and is
      a lot easier to navigate. My favorite permanent section is the European painting
      section on the second floor, which houses many excellent and well-labeled pieces
      by Monet, Van Gogh, and Pissarro. The Egyptian section is also excellent and
      is as good as the Egyptian Museum in Egypt. They also have a yearly fashion
      exhibit (China Through the Looking Glass a few years ago, Camp this year) that
      is well curated and well attended. Since it&#39;s one of the world&#39;s best
      museums, it can get pretty crowded, especially on weekends. You can spend the
      whole day here and still not finish seeing everything.

      simply too much to do in one visit. If you only have one day then chose carefully,
      there are just so many directions to go, all tremendous.<br><br>I personally

      through room after room and you will be transported from one incredible place

      garden. The view of the NYC skyline from the roof is great! There&#39;s a bar
      up there (be warned that the drinks and wine seemed to be $15+ each). I bought
