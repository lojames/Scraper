  - :body: 'Levain Bakery is the #1 best dessert destination at an affordable price
      in Manhattan.<br><br>Each cookie (just $4) is basically an entire meal, but
      it&#39;s so much more than even that. <br><br>I&#39;ve been happily married
      for 32 years now, and like you&#39;d expect, my wife and I&#39;s sex life has
      diminished over the decades. We&#39;re no longer as young as we once were. <br><br>We&#39;ve
      tried EVERYTHING to add spice to the bedroom. And I mean everything. Balls,
      chains, whips, peanut butter, handcuffs. It works temporarily, but the excitement
      dies down. <br><br>Whenever we need to get in the mood now, we get the Dark
      Chocolate Chocolate Chip cookie and eat half each. It invigorates us enough
      to last us the entire night. It&#39;s basically Viagra (note: I am not a doctor).
      And so far, the excitement hasn&#39;t gone away!! Ill never stop coming here,
      because I want to keep coming.'

  - :body: The hype and the line is worth it. These cookies are deliciously addictive
      - soft, gooey, warm, and soulful. They are also the size of your face (at not
      an unreasonable price). We waited maybe about 15 minutes - the line moves pretty
      quickly. We ordered a variety - all of them were pretty good (and warm out of
      the oven!), though the original was the best for me. <br><br>It was a nice day
      and we walked to Central Park afterwards to enjoy every single bite. There wasn&#39;t
      after all much place to sit - it&#39;s more of a grab and go.

  - :body: Good, large, gooey cookies, but honestly not my favorite type of cookie
      in the world. Their cookies are very fat and heavy. While when they are right
      out of the oven they are melty and delicious, they then get hard and aren&#39;t
      as good later. I personally prefer thinner cookies, but you should try these
      at least once. They are extremely filling and extremely large, definitely split
      between people.<br><br>There is usually a line, but it moves pretty fast.

  - :body: Chocolate chip walnut cookies are what this place is known and as I prefer
      nut based cookies outside of peanut butter, I got one of those. Massive as everyone
      else notes. They were closing soon but the cookie tasted quite fresh. It was
      a soft on the inside with a nice crispy outside. There was great chocolate flavor
      with a large number of walnuts. Well balanced and excellent.<br><br>Their other
      pastries are fine but they are known for their cookies for a reason. The staff
      was very nice also. I&#39;d post more but frankly, there&#39;s no need. There&#39;s
      7700 other reviews and counting for a very good reason here. It&#39;s not too
      pricey for the size and easily split-able for 2 tourists (or 1 hungry New Yorker.)

      This location just had cookies. For me- 1 star i am allergic to peanuts and
      wheat and they have a sign saying dont eat there if you have allergies. They
      also dont have gluten free goodies. The customer service is a 5 star though
      the guy covering the line was very personable. The chocolate chip ones my friends
      said were okay. Undercooked (how i like my cookies though) and they said they
      tasted like boxed cookies. But the chocolate chocolate chip they all loved.
      Said it tasted like brownies. Only downside is they were too rich-everyone agreed
