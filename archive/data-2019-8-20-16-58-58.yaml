  - :body: The Halal Guys is iconic NYC. Everyone used to flock here after a night
      in the clubs back in the 00&#39;s.  The lines were long.  The customers drunk,
      boisterous and oftentimes looking to pick a fight.  And someone would always
      wait to buy food for everyone else.  10 combos, extra white sauce please.  <br><br>Nowadays,
      the lines are short and orderly.  Everyone knows they&#39;ll get their food.  DH
      and I were walking to Hells Kitchen last week when we passed Halal Guys.  We
      reminisced about all the times we ate their combo plate, we had even made it
      a moving day ritual at one time.  Of course, we stopped in our tracks, skipping
      out on our reservation and got on line.  We needed to see if the food was even
      close to our memories.  The line moved fast.  DH ordered a regular combo and
      I ordered a small falafel platter as I stopped eating meat 2 years ago. Both
      come with yellow rice, lettuce and pita.  The white sauce was just as good as
      I remember it.  You need it, the food is a bit dry without it and the hot sauce
      is as spicy as I remember it.  Use sparingly!!  You will ruin your food if you
      use too much, in addition to burn your mouth!  Use a little at a time, you can
      always add more!  My falafel was decent, not the best I&#39;ve ever had, but
      the white sauce and hot sauce made the dish.  The small was just the right portion
      size. <br><br>I don&#39;t usually eat street meat so don&#39;t have a point
      of comparison.  I can say you should eat at Halal Guys though because it&#39;s
      still the best street meat I&#39;ve ever eaten!

      hard to eat standing up. Not a complaint because that&#39;s what happens when
      you go to a food truck. So if comfort is really important then this might not
      be the right spot. <br><br>Overall really good, and I highly recommend it.

      is a food cart. Though now, they have multiple branches in the city itself and
      also all over the country and the world which are not food carts but food joints
      with sitting space.<br><br>Simple menu - chicken (great tasting), beef (even
      better tasting), pork (not anymore at this cart for some reason - but again
      is great tasting), falafel (kind of okay tasting) - over yellow over rice. With
      white sauce (yum - put lots), hot sauce (yum but very spicy. Pro tip- put only
      a few drops ..it would burn your mouth !!!!) and bbq sauce (good). <br>This
      joint doesn&#39;t have it but some of them also have gyros and baklava (very
      sweet but really good).<br><br>$7 per plate (was $6 till very recently) - huge
      portions - would easily last 2 meals.<br><br>Open till late. And almost till
      4 am on the weekends. Have had many a post-binge-drinking-night-3am-meals here
      !<br><br>Only con - No sitting at this location. So people mostly do a take
      away or sit on the parapets of the surrounding buildings.<br><br>Always a long

      2 packets of white sauce which is world popular and one of the main reason why
      halal guys is soooo popular. You also get few packets of red sauce. It&#39;s
      extremely spicy but adds a good flavor. <br><br>They didn&#39;t have any baklava

  - :body: My girlfriend from NYC directed us to eat here. Her specific instruction
      was to go to &#34;The Halal Guys&#34; cart. The name must have all three words,
      no less/no more, or else you&#39;re eating at a copy cat! THE. HALAL. GUYS.
      Remember that! And, it&#39;s the cart across the street from Hilton on W 53rd
      and 6th.<br><br>We found THE HALAL GUYS! Lol. Yep, there was a little wait on
      a Thursday at 1:30pm. But, not too long. A huge batch of meats were already
      prepared on the hot plate and ready to be scooped up and placed into a round
      foil platter or wrapped up into a sandwich.<br><br>Between the two of us, we
      decided to share a regular size Platter C, which was the Chicken and Beef Gyro
      combo. Lettuce, chicken, and beef over a bed of turmeric and cumin seasoned
      basmati rice with a few small slices of pita bread. Our plate was placed into
      a plastic bag with two packets of their famous white sauce and one packet of
      red sauce.<br><br>Now, my friend said the sauce packets are like gold. So, the
      smart thing to do is drizzle some sauce onto your food from the bottles at the
      cart and then you can save your packets for later! Unfortunately, no sauce bottles
      at the cart. Not sure if they discontinued this offering. Probably caught onto
      the sauce hype because I hear they actually charge for extra packets. The other
      tip, even if you love spicy, was to only squirt the red sauce into one corner
      instead of ALL OVER like the white sauce. Lol. I can see why. Trust me. It&#39;s
      hotttt!!!! And I love spicy!!!!<br><br>So since we were on vacay and didn&#39;t
      have an office to return to, we actually walked into the nearest Starbucks to
      purchase some cold beverages and then feast on our plates (we noticed others
      doing this, too!) in an air conditioned space.<br><br>The verdict?? OMG!! So
      DELICIOUS!! The chicken and beef were nicely seasoned and chopped in such a

      like a chicken over rice platter at 2:00 in the morning. However, there has
      to be well over a thousand in the city. But this one? This is THE Halal Cart.
      <br><br>I&#39;m not sure if this was the first, or how this cart came to stardom,
      but this was the cart that started the national chain of Halal Guys locations.
      They&#39;re fast, they&#39;re efficient, and they make some good food.<br><br>You&#39;ll
      see people lined up from streets away below their yellow umbrellas... and the
      lines MOVE. You can be in the back of a line of 30 people, and still get your
      food within minutes. Right near the carts is a block of public benches, providing
      a good place to sit down with your food.<br><br>The regular sized platter itself
      is enough food for the entire day in one sitting, but they also offer a small
      sized platter or gyros.<br><br>All in all, if you want to eat a lot for cheap
      in New York City, and you want it fast? Go to the Halal Guys.

      We ordered the chicken and gyro combo platter. Not to be extra, but this is
      literally the best Hala food (and food in general) that we&#39;ve ever had.
      Their portions were perfect, the meat was well seasoned, the rice was unique,
      and their hot sauce packs a punch!  Everything went perfectly together. <br><br>Overall:
      One of the best food places in New York. Everybody needs to eat here at some
      point in their life. You get more than your money&#39;s worth here and won&#39;t

      offs&#34; throughout the city so be aware of the fact if you are searching for
      them.<br><br>There happened to be no line when I got there but sure enough I

      though I wanted a $6.00 beef gyro I ended up with a $9.00 beef halal dinner!<br><br>I
      took my meal to the hotel room and ate it there. This meat is very good and
      it is accompanied by a salad, rice, and sliced pita bread. They also give you
      a white sauce and hot sauce if you want to add to it. I used the white sauce
      and it was so good and very filling.<br><br>You can&#39;t beat a bargain like
      that here in NY. There&#39;s no best time to go but I did notice two more stands
      in the same general vicinity. They are marked &#34;the real&#34; Halal guys.  I

      extra hot sauces. They sure know the fastest way to my heart. Meat + rice +
      EXTRA hot sauce. What else can I possibly ask for? <br><br>Apparently this place
      started all the way back in 1990, and 3 partners came up with a halal food cart
      with chicken and gyro over rice because of a high demand from Muslim cab drivers!
      Good thing they did because I freaking LOVE this place. <br><br>Whenever I come
      up to NY for work, I stand in the ridiculous line that goes for a block or two
      so that I can buy 4 - 6 platters of Combo ($8/each) to bring back home (Baltimore)
      with me. Of course, extra hot sauce please! <br><br>When I get home, I open
      up these bad boys, drown them in their famous white and red sauce. CAUTION:
      their red/hot sauce is ACTUALLY spicy!!!! I thought I was born with an iron
      stomach that can withstand all levels of spice but Halal Guys proved me wrong
      - usually 1 packet of red sauce for the entire platter is enough but I like
      to push my limit and put 2 - 3 packets. YESSSSSS, BURN MY SOUL!!!!<br><br>Their
      pita bread does get soggy because it sits in the platter on the way home but
      this is easily fixed if I pop them into the toaster oven for a few minutes!'

      a moving day ritual at one time.  Of course, we stopped in our tracks, skipping
      out on our reservation and got on line.  We needed to see if the food was even
      close to our memories.  The line moved fast.  DH ordered a regular combo and
      I ordered a small falafel platter as I stopped eating meat 2 years ago. Both
      come with yellow rice, lettuce and pita.  The white sauce was just as good as
      I remember it.  You need it, the food is a bit dry without it and the hot sauce
      is as spicy as I remember it.  Use sparingly!!  You will ruin your food if you

      basmati rice with a few small slices of pita bread. Our plate was placed into
      a plastic bag with two packets of their famous white sauce and one packet of
      red sauce.<br><br>Now, my friend said the sauce packets are like gold. So, the
      smart thing to do is drizzle some sauce onto your food from the bottles at the
      cart and then you can save your packets for later! Unfortunately, no sauce bottles
      at the cart. Not sure if they discontinued this offering. Probably caught onto
      the sauce hype because I hear they actually charge for extra packets. The other
      tip, even if you love spicy, was to only squirt the red sauce into one corner
      instead of ALL OVER like the white sauce. Lol. I can see why. Trust me. It&#39;s
      hotttt!!!! And I love spicy!!!!<br><br>So since we were on vacay and didn&#39;t
      have an office to return to, we actually walked into the nearest Starbucks to

    :comment: "$9- regular combo platter"
    :body: Because of this place&#39;s insane popularity, i decided to take the subway
      here just to try it out. It was around 6pm and still raining a bit. I ordered
      a combo platter and got my food very fast because all the guy did was scoop
      the content from the containers. <br><br>I don&#39;t know if they normally would
      refresh it up when it&#39;s not raining, but maybe because they didn&#39;t,
      the meat felt a bit dry. Rice was good, i always enjoy Mediterranean rice. The
      vegetable portion was just iceberg lettuce. Where sauce was decent. Hot sauce
      was supppper hot like the dry hot type that just burns. The whole experience
      just felt underwhelming and disappointing. I have had tastier Mediterranean
      food from other food stands of NYC.

      a good place to sit down with your food.<br><br>The regular sized platter itself
      is enough food for the entire day in one sitting, but they also offer a small
      sized platter or gyros.<br><br>All in all, if you want to eat a lot for cheap

    :body: 'Atmosphere: Looked like other Halal carts. The menu is simple and easy
      to navigate.<br><br>Service: Fast service! There was no line since we went at
      an awkward time (10:30 am), but the line looked longer during the lunch rush.<br><br>Food:
      We ordered the chicken and gyro combo platter. Not to be extra, but this is
      literally the best Hala food (and food in general) that we&#39;ve ever had.
      Their portions were perfect, the meat was well seasoned, the rice was unique,
      and their hot sauce packs a punch!  Everything went perfectly together. <br><br>Overall:
      One of the best food places in New York. Everybody needs to eat here at some
      point in their life. You get more than your money&#39;s worth here and won&#39;t
      be disappointed! We&#39;d recommend beating the lunch/dinner rushes and having
      a drink to pair with the delicious hot sauce!'
